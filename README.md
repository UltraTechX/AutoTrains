# Automatic Trains Mod
A new minecraft mod for 1.7.10 that revolutionizes railway transportation in minecraft!

Known issues that we cannot fix inside the code currently (with solutions):

ISSUE: some textures from blocks that are inside the mod seem to have open gaps between them

FIX: make sure anisotropic filtering is set to 2 or above (anything but off) and make sure mipmap levels are under 4 (anything but max mipmap levels)


will add more here in the future - Ultra
